# animal-taxonomy-wikipedia-scraper
A script that scrapes data about selected animals on wikipedia and lists their taxonomy info in a csv file.

Works around 80% of the time, will not work on certain animals due to how wikipedia is formatted. There may be errors for the genus of each species due to how the data is presented on wikipedia.

Any constructive criticism is welcomed!
