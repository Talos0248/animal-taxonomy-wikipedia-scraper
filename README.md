# animal-taxonomy-wikipedia-scraper
A script that scrapes data about selected animals on wikipedia and lists their taxonomy and conservation info in a csv file. Conservation status is also provided (if available).

Included within is the script itself and the csv file generated using the given animal names in the script. As you can see from the csv, the script is far from perfect, would be grateful for any suggestions on how to improve the script.

Works around 80% of the time, will not work on certain animals due to how wikipedia is formatted. There may be errors for the genus of each species due to how the data is presented on wikipedia.

Any constructive criticism is welcomed!
